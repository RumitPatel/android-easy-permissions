EasyPermissions is created to make the runtime permissions easier.

# Download
Mention dependency in ```build.gradle(app)```
```kotlin
implementation("io.github.rumitpatel:easy-permissions:1.0.5")
```

# How do I use EasyPermissions?
**Step:1** Create an object of EasyPermission.
```kotlin
private var easyPermissions: EasyPermission? = null
```

**Step:2** Initiate permission obj in ```obCreate()``` method. Also handle callback here.

```kotlin
private fun initializePermissionObj() {
    easyPermissions = EasyPermissions.Builder(this@PermissionDemoActivity)
        .setPermissionType(EasyPermissions.PermissionType.PERMISSION_CAMERA_AND_STORAGE)
        .setOnPermissionListener(object : OnPermissionsListener {
            override fun onGranted() {
                toast(getString(R.string.permission_granted))
            }

            override fun onDeclined(shouldRequestAgain: Boolean) {
                toast(getString(R.string.permission_declined))
                if (shouldRequestAgain) {
                    // You can request again by calling "easyPermissions?.launch()" here.
                } else {
                    //Never ask again selected, dismissed the dialog, or device policy prohibits the app from having that permission
                    // For example, Settings dialog opened here.
                    showSettingsDialog()
                }
            }
        })
        .build()
}
```

**Step:3** Simply launch the launcher.

```kotlin
buttonTest.setOnClickListener {
    easyPermissions?.launch()
}
```
**Note:** Please make sure the required permissions are added in ```Androidmanifest.xml``` too.
